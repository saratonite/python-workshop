#Lists


#### Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

print(numbers[2])
